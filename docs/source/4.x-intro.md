# What's new in Gluu Server v4

## Version 4.0 Beta

### Extensive Passport redesign
For CE 4.0, we've streamlined and enhanced Passport for inbound identity.  We simplified attribute mapping and transformation, and added support for OpenID Connect providers through oxd. All Passport configuration changes now take place in the oxTrust admin UI. [Read the docs](./authn-guide/passport.md).

### Added Gluu Radius Server
The Gluu Server now ships with a built-in RADIUS server, based on the TinyRadius Java library. Gluu Radius supports RADIUS authentication, but not accounting support. [Read the docs](./admin-guide/radius-server/gluu-radius.md).

### Improved server clean up
Introduced in CE 3.1.6, `cleanService` is now configurable. This service periodically removes unused and expired cache and session-related database entries to improve server performance. [Read the docs](./operation/cleanup.md).

### Minor bug fixes and feature improvements
A variety of bug fixes and UX improvements are included with the latest release. See our [complete release notes](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/4.0/release-notes/#changes).
