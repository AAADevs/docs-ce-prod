# What's new in Gluu Server v4

## Version 4.0 Beta

### Extensive Passport redesign
For CE 4.0, we've streamlined and enhanced Passport for inbound identity.  We simplified attribute mapping and transformation, and added support for OpenID Connect providers through oxd. All Passport configuration changes now take place in the oxTrust admin UI. [Read the docs](./authn-guide/passport.md).

### More SAML IDP Features
NameID's can now be [configured inside oxTrust](./admin-guide/saml.md#configure-nameid-in-oxtrust), and [SAML ACRS parameters](./admin-guide/saml.md#authncontextclassref-support) are now supported, which, when used in conjunction with [force authentication](./admin-guide/saml.md#force-authentication), enables stepped-up authentication for SAML SPs. 

### Support for Radius Authentication
The Gluu Server now ships with optional support for a RADIUS server to enable 2FA via Super Gluu to non-web applications like SSH, VPN, and wi-fi. [Read the docs](./admin-guide/radius-server/gluu-radius.md).

### Improved clean up service
Introduced in CE 3.1.6, `cleanService` is now more configurable. This service periodically removes unused and expired cache and session-related database entries to improve server performance. [Read the docs](./operation/cleanup.md).

### Minor bug fixes and feature improvements
A variety of bug fixes and UX improvements are included with the latest release. See our [complete release notes](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/4.0/release-notes/#changes).
