# Gluu Server Community Edition (CE) 3.0.2 Documentation
## Introduction
The Gluu Server is a free open source identity and access management 
(IAM) platform. The most common use case for the Gluu Server is Single 
Sign-On (SSO). Other common use cases include mobile authentication, 
API access management, two-factor authentication, customer identity
and access management (CIAM) and identity federation. 

The Gluu Server is a container distribution composed of software written by Gluu and incorporated from other open source projects. Gluu
projects are frequently prefixed with our open source handle: **ox** (e.g. oxAuth, oxTrust). Any code in the Gluu Server that we wrote is MIT license, and is available on [Github](https://github.com/GluuFederation/). 

SaaS, custom, open source and commercial software can be made more 
secure by leveraging a central authentication and authorization service. 
Because there are so many different kinds of apps, there is no way to 
"top down" implement proprietary security mechanisms. This is why
open standards are so important for IAM. 

While there are many open protocols for IAM, Gluu focuses on just a few. 
Consolidation saves money, and one-off integrations should be avoided. 
Our goal was to support the most widely adopted older protocols, and the 
most promising new protocols. 

The Gluu Server supports the following open web standards for 
authentication, authorization, federated identity, and identity management:

- OAuth 2.0    
- SAML 2.0   
- OpenID Connect    
- User Managed Access (UMA)    
- System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)    
- FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)    
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)   

If this is your first exposure to the Gluu Server, welcome to the 
community! We want to see the ecosystem flourish, and ultimately make 
the Internet a safer, more privacy protected place. In order to do that, 
we believe we need to keep the Gluu Server free so all kinds of 
organizations can use, contribute and benefit from the software.

These docs are not perfect! Please help us make them so by submitting
any improvements to our [Documentation Github](https://github.com/GluuFederation/docs-ce-prod).
If you're a Github pro, submit a pull request. If not, just open an issue
on any typos, bugs, or improvements you'd lie to see. We need your
help... even if you're not a coder, you can contribute! 

## Persistence
The Gluu Server uses the open source OpenLDAP server as its internal directory server to store data generated by the service, such as user profiles, configuration data, tokens and credentials. 

##  oxd Client Software
To integrate web applications with the Gluu Server for SSO you can use any existing or custom written SAML or OpenID Connect client software. However, you may want to consider using our commercial client software, [oxd](https://oxd.gluu.org), for the following reasons: 
 
1. oxd is super-easy to use; 
2. We keep updating oxd to address the latest OAuth 2.0 security knowledge; 
3. We can provide more complete end-to-end support if we know both the client and server software;
4. In addition to a simple JSON/REST API, there are oxd libraries for Php, Python, Java, Node, Ruby, C#, Perl and Go;
5. There are oxd plugins for many popular applications like: Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, OpenCart, SugarCRM, SuiteCRM, Roundcube, Shopify, and Kong. More are being added too. Next on the list are: MatterMost, RocketChat, NextCloud, and Liferay.

## Super Gluu Authentication App
Super Gluu is a free authentication mobile app for iOS and Android. Super Gluu can be used to achieve multi-factor authentication to applications that use your free open source Gluu Server for login. Learn more in the [Super Gluu docs](https://gluu.org/docs/supergluu).
