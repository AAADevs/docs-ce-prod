# What's new in Gluu Server 3.1.x
We've made some significant updates to Gluu Sever 3.1.x to improve performance and functionality. The following provides some additional details about the most important changes.

## UMA 2
The Gluu Server 3.1.x distribution supports the latest UMA 2.0 specification. UMA 2.0 reduces overlap with OAuth 2.0 and improves the spec to better support wider ecosystems of users and IoT use cases. 

## Redis Caching
To improve performance, the Gluu Server now bundles Redis to store short-lived objects. This reduces the number of writes to the LDAP database, including the performance of your underlying directory services. 

## From Seam to Weld
Seam was end-of-lifed, and in Gluu Server 3.1.x has been replaced by the Weld framework. 

## Internationalization
The Gluu Server 3.1.x includes language packs that enable the user interface to be translated into the language of your choice.
