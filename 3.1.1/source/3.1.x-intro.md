# What's new in Gluu Server 3.1.x
We've made some significant updates to Gluu Sever 3.1.x to improve performance and functionality. The following provides some additional details about the most important changes.

## UMA 2
The Gluu Server 3.1.x distribution supports the latest UMA 2.0 specification. UMA 2.0 reduces overlap with OAuth 2.0 and is now a more complimentary specification with OpenID Connect.   

## Redis Caching
To improve performance, the Gluu Server now bundles Redis to store short-lived objects. This reduces the number of writes to the LDAP database, including the performance of your underlying directory services. 

## From Seam to Weld
Seam was end-of-lifed, and in Gluu Server 3.1.x has been replaced by the Weld framework. 

## From Tomcat to Jetty

## Internationalization
