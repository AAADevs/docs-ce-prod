# Gluu Server Community Edition (CE) 3.1.1 Documentation
## Introduction
The Gluu Server is a free open source identity and access management (IAM) platform. With a Gluu Server, you can provide one central authentication and authorization point for many SaaS, custom, open source and commercial web and mobile applications.  

The most common use cases for the Gluu Server include:

- Single sign-on (SSO)   
- Mobile authentication    
- API access management  
- Two-factor authentication 
- Customer identity and access management (CIAM)   
- Identity federation.  

### Open Standards
The Gluu Server implements open web standards for authentication, authorization, federated identity, and identity management:

- OAuth 2.0    
- SAML 2.0   
- OpenID Connect    
- User Managed Access 2.0 (UMA)    
- System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)    
- FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)    
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)   

### Free Open Source Software
All software included in the Gluu Server distribution is free open source software that can be used in production for free. Learn more about the open source licenses in use [below](#license). 

## Installation
The Gluu Server can be installed on the cloud provider of your choice using one of our easy-to-install Linux packages for Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and Debian. Follow our [VM preparation guide](./installation-guide/index.md) to get started. 

## Directory Service
All data generated by the Gluu Server is stored in its local Gluu OpenLDAP (included in every deployment). In the LDAP you can see full details like how OpenID Connect clients are stored and how user objects are mapped in the LDAP tree. Learn more in the [user management guide](./user-management/local-user-management.md)

If you have an existing Active Directory or backend LDAP server, you can sync data to your local Gluu OpenLDAP using the [Cache Refresh process](./user-management/ldap-sync.md). 

!!! Note
    The Gluu Server always needs identity data stored locally. Without a local copy of identity data, the service will not work. 

## Identity Management
Via the "oxTrust" admin interface, and using an LDAP browser, you can manage your Gluu Server's identity and object data such as user profiles, configuration data, tokens and credentials. 

The Gluu Server does **not** do things like delegated administration, role definition, approvals and workflows, etc. In large enterprise workflows the Gluu Server is a consumer of identity management and governance data and policies. 

If you have an existing identity management platform, the Gluu Server can be integrated using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management protocol, aka [SCIM](./user-management/scim2.md). 

!!! Note
    If you are looking for a good open source IDM and governance platform, we recommend checking out [Evolveum Midpoint](https://evolveum.com/midpoint/). 

##  SSO Integrations
The Gluu Server acts as an identity provider (IDP) in single sign-on workflows. Users from web and mobile applications are redirected to Gluu for "sign-on", and when successful, are redirected back to applications with claims (or attributes) about themselves. 

The Gluu Server supports a variety of application integration strategies for web and mobile applications. Learn more in our [SSO integration guide](./integration/index.md).

## Strong Authentication
One of the biggest benefits of a central authentication system is the ability to enforce strong authentication in one place for all your apps. The Gluu Server was designed to be very flexible in accommodating not only a range of authentication mechanisms, but also custom business logic for how authentication should be applied in practice. 

Learn more about how to configure the Gluu Server's out-of-the-box and custom strong authentication options in the [authentication guide](./authn-guide/intro.md).
