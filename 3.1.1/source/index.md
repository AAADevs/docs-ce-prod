# Gluu Server Community Edition (CE) 3.1.1 Documentation
## Introduction
The Gluu Server is a free open source identity and access management 
(IAM) platform. The most common use cases for the Gluu Server include:

- Single Sign-On (SSO)   
- Mobile authentication    
- API access management  
- Two-factor authentication 
- Customer identity and access management (CIAM)   
- Identity federation.  

SaaS, custom, open source and commercial software can be made more 
secure by leveraging a central authentication and authorization service. 
Because there are so many different kinds of apps, there is no way to 
"top down" implement proprietary security mechanisms. This is why
open standards are so important for IAM. 

### Open Standards
While there are many open standards for IAM, Gluu focuses on just a few. Consolidation saves money, and one-off integrations should be avoided. The Gluu Server implements the following open web standards for authentication, authorization, federated identity, and identity management:

- OAuth 2.0    
- SAML 2.0   
- OpenID Connect    
- User Managed Access 2.0 (UMA)    
- System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)    
- FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)    
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)   

## Installation
You can deploy the Gluu Server on the cloud provider of your choice using one of our easy-to-install Linux packages for Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and Debian. Follow our [VM preparation guide](./installation-guide/index.md) to get started. 

## Identity Management
The Gluu Server uses the open source OpenLDAP server as its internal directory server to store data generated by the service, such as user profiles, configuration data, tokens and credentials. The Gluu Server also supports the SCIM 2 APIs to simplify and standardize user provisioning and user management in the cloud. Learn more in the [user management guide](./user-management/local-user-management.md)

##  SSO Integrations
The Gluu Server supports a variety of SSO integration strategies for web and mobile applications. Learn more in our [SSO integration guide](./integration/index.md).

## Strong Authentication
One of the biggest benefits of a central authentication system is the ability to enforce strong authentication in one place for all your apps. The Gluu Server was designed to be very flexible in accommodating not only a range of authentication mechanisms, but also custom business logic for how authentication should be applied in practice. Learn more about how to configure the Gluu Server's out-of-the-box and custom strong authentication options in the [authentication guide](./authn-guide/intro.md).
